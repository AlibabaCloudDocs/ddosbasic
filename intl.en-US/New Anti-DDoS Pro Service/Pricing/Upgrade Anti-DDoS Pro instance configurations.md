# Upgrade Anti-DDoS Pro instance configurations {#task737 .task}

If your current Anti-DDoS Pro instance cannot meet your needs, you can always upgrade its configurations to increase the basic bandwidth, domains, ports, or service bandwidth in the Anti-DDoS Pro console.

Currently, Anti-DDoS Pro allows you to increase the basic bandwidth, domains, ports, and service bandwidth during the upgrade. You need to pay additional fees for the increased capabilities. The new configurations immediately take effect after you make the payment.

**Note:** You cannot decrease the basic bandwidth, domains, ports, or service bandwidth after the upgrade.

The price for the upgrades is calculated as follows:

-   Domains: For each new domain, Anti-DDoS Pro charges USD 46.88 per month. This fee is calculated based on your remaining subscription time.

    **Note:** If your Anti-DDoS Pro instance is associated with 100 domains, Anti-DDoS Pro charges USD 35.16 per month for each domain over the 100 threshold.

-   Ports: For each new port, Anti-DDoS Pro charges USD 7.81 per month. This fee is calculated based on your remaining subscription time.
-   Service Bandwidth: For each Mbit/s of bandwidth, Anti-DDoS Pro charges additional USD 15.63 per month. This fee is calculated based on your remaining subscription time.

    **Note:** Anti-DDoS Pro offers different prices for different bandwidth usage. If your service bandwidth ranges from 100 Mbit/s to 600 Mbit/s, Anti-DDoS Pro charges USD 15.63 per month for each Mbit/s of bandwidth. If your service bandwidth is greater than 600 Mbit/s, Anti-DDoS Pro charges USD 11.72 per month for each Mbit/s of bandwidth over the 600 threshold.
