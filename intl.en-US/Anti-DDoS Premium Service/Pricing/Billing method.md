## The advanced mitigation of Anti-DDoS Premium {#section_jdh_prd_ggb .section}

Anti-DDoS Premium aims to defend against every single DDoS attack by integrating all mitigation capacities of global Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS scrubbing centers to protect your business.

In most cases, the attack risk obviously decreases when you successfully defend against DDoS attacks by using Anti-DDoS services. Generally, malicious attackers launch DDoS attacks to cause losses of your business. If the attackers fail to achieve the purpose, the DDoS attack ends due to the cost of launching attacks. Therefore, the advanced mitigation of Anti-DDoS Premium does not have a limited protection capacity.

**Note:** Alibaba Cloud keeps rights of actions when attacks against your business impact the infrastructure of Alibaba Cloud International Anti-DDoS scrubbing centers. Once the actions are triggered on your Anti-DDoS Premium instance, your protected business may be affected. The action includes but not limited to “black hole” of the IP addresses being attacked, or alteration to the routing of the traffic destined to the IP addresses being attacked.

## The plans of Anti-DDoS Premium {#section_nk1_y4d_ggb .section}

-   Insurance Plan

    Anti-DDoS Premium Insurance Plan provides two advanced mitigations \(unlimited full-capacity protection\) for each month. The advanced mitigation is enabled to provide unlimited protection with full capacity within 24 hours for your business after it suffers DDoS attacks, and this consumes one advanced mitigation. The advanced mitigations are reset to two at the beginning of every month during the service period.

    For example, from September 12th 11:20:00, a protected IP suffers DDoS attacks and advanced mitigation is triggered. Within 24 hours, Anti-DDoS Premium provides unlimited protection with full capacity for the IP. Then, from September 13th 18:50:00, the protected IP suffers DDoS attacks and advanced mitigation is triggered again. 24 hours later, the unlimited protection with full capacity stops and the two advanced mitigation opportunities of the Anti-DDoS Premium Insurance instance in September exhausts. The advanced mitigation opportunities are automatically reset to two at the beginning of next month, October 1st.
