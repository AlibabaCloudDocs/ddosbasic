# Global advanced mitigation sessions {#concept_e2x_ttf_4gb .concept}

If the two advanced mitigation sessions for the month of an Anti-DDoS Premium Insurance Plan instance have been used up, you can purchase additional global advanced mitigation sessions to achieve more unlimited mitigation capabilities.

Each month, Anti-DDoS Premium Insurance Plan provides two free advanced mitigation sessions by default, featuring unlimited mitigation capabilities. This protects your businesses against DDoS attacks within 24 hours after an attack has been detected, and consumes one advanced mitigation session.

If the business suffers from frequent large-traffic attacks, the two advanced mitigation sessions offered by default may fail to guarantee the service availability. In this case, you can purchase global advanced mitigation sessions to obtain more advanced mitigation sessions for the Anti-DDoS Premium instances in your account.

## Notes {#section_myl_ybg_4gb .section}

If the two free advanced DDoS mitigation sessions for the month have been used up and your business still suffers from large-traffic attacks, with the traffic volume exceeding the basic mitigation threshold, the additional global advanced mitigation sessions you have purchased will be consumed to provide unlimited mitigation capacities.

You do not need to bind the global advanced mitigation sessions to a specific instance. You can use the global advanced mitigation sessions for all instances that meet the usage requirements.

**Usage requirements**

-   The Insure Plan instance is valid.
-   The advanced mitigation feature of the account is not frozen.

    **Note:** When the number of advanced mitigation sessions, including the number of global advanced mitigation sessions, consumed by all instances in your account in the current month exceeds 10, the advanced mitigation feature will be automatically frozen. You must wait until the next calendar month to use this feature.

    If your business is subject to frequent large-traffic attacks, we recommend that you purchase Unlimited Plan instances to protect your business.
