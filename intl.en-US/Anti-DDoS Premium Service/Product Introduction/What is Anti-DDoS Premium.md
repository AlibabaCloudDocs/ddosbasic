# What is Anti-DDoS Premium {#concept_86301_zh .concept}

For users who have business servers deployed outside the mainland China, Alibaba Cloud provides the Anti-DDoS Premium service to mitigate DDoS attacks.

By enabling Anti-DDoS Premium for your server that deployed outside the mainland China, all attack traffic against your server is pulled to your Anti-DDoS Premiumâ€™s dedicated IP. Then, the Anti-DDoS Premium service filters attack traffic that diverted to global distributed scrubbing centers by using Anycast technology, and forward clean traffic back to the origin server. This mostly improves the stability of your business.
