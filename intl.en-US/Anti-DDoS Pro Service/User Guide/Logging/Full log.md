# Full log {#concept_85007_zh .concept}

According to APNIC DDoS threat landscape in 2017, more than 80% of DDoS attacks mix HTTP and HTTPS flood attacks, and have a high level of concealment. Therefore, it is especially important to analyze the access and attack behavior by using logs, and apply a protection strategy.

Now, Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro has integrated with Log Service on website access logs \(including HTTP flood attack logs\), to provide real-time analysis and reporting center features.

Log Service supports the real-time collection of Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro website access logs, HTTP flood attack logs, and supports real-time query and analysis of collected log data. The results of the query are displayed in the form of dashboards.

The total log volume is about 96 GB per day, not exceeding the FreeTier quota, and no charge is generated. However, if the access log volume of your website business exceeds the FreeTier quota, extra charges can appear.

    For example, view the website access log by using the following statement:

    `__topic__: DDoS_access_log` 

-   Track HTTP flood attack source
    -   For example, analyze the HTTP flood attack country distribution recorded in the access log by the following statement:

        `__topic__: DDoS_access_log and cc_blocks > 0| SELECT ip_to_country(if(real_client_ip='-', remote_addr, real_client_ip)) as country, count(1) as "Attack Times" group by country`

    -   For example, view the access PV by the following statement:

        `__topic__: DDoS_access_log | select count(1) as PV`

-   Website operation analysis

    Anti-DDoS Pro access log records the website access data in real time. You can perform SQL query analysis of the collected access log data to obtain real-time access status, such as determining the website popularity, the source and channel of the access, the client distribution, and assist in website operation analysis.

    For example, view the visitor traffic distribution from different network providers:

    `__topic__: DDoS_access_log | select ip_to_provider(if(real_client_ip='-', remote_addr, real_client_ip)) as provider, round(sum(request_length)/1024.0/1024.0, 3) as mb_in group by provider having ip_to_provider(if(real_client_ip='-', remote_addr, real_client_ip)) <> '' order by mb_in desc limit 10`
