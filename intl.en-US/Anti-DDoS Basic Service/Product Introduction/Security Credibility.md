## I. Program introduction {#section_ujy_1kz_bgb .section}

Security Credibility is a program that Alibaba Cloud has developed to improve your user experience during security protection and provide higher security capabilities. Alibaba Cloud provides users in this program with flexible anti-DDoS protection capabilities based on the security credibility of the user.

Currently, you can join Security Credibility for free.

## II. Program benefits { .section}

-    **A higher black hole threshold**. The black hole threshold is adjusted flexibly based on your credit score. For most users, the adjusted black hole threshold is no smaller than the default threshold. This lowers the probability that your servers fall into a black hole.
-    **Open credibility evaluation criteria**. The members of this program can improve their credibility based on the credibility evaluation criteria to obtain more protection capabilities.

## III. Security protection mechanism { .section}

-   The anti-DDoS protection capability of a user is adjusted based on the security credit score of the user. Most users can obtain additional anti-DDoS protection capability for free.
-   The security credit score is the basis for calculating the black hole threshold. If the attack traffic volume is below this threshold, Alibaba Cloud protects your ECS and SLB instances against the attacks at zero cost. If your servers fall into black holes frequently, the black hole threshold is lowered to the default value. If the attack traffic volume exceeds the current threshold, your servers fall into a black hole to block all IP addresses.
-   Attacks affect the next credibility evaluation.
-   The security protection capabilities that you can obtain from the program are provided by a resource pool shared by all members of the program. In standard cases, Alibaba Cloud provides you with security protection capabilities based on your credit score. However, if the members of the program encounter attacks or other malicious events together and the resources in the shared resource pool run out, your security protection capabilities may be reduced.
-   For users with frequent black holing, Alibaba Cloud reserves the right to increase the black hole duration and lower the black hole threshold. You can go to the console to view the black hole threshold and duration.
-   If the attack traffic volume exceeds the traffic covered by the additional protection capabilities provided by the program, you must purchase Anti-DDoS Pro to obtain higher protection capabilities. Otherwise, services running on your ECS and SLB instances may be interrupted due to DDoS attacks.
-   Make sure to keep your security credit score and related information confidential.
